FRONTEND TO-DO:
    - Currently, the Message list relies on a windows.location.reload() to update the list of messages each time a new message is posted. Need to figure out how to make this happen more cleanly, possibly with the useEffect
    - need to add styling to Messages
    - need to breakup "Messages" page to display either a single (random?) message or the entire list.
